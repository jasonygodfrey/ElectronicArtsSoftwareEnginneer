Structure of a Feature Proposal

At the end of the day, it’s far more important to articulate your idea well than to follow a strict document structure. That being said, most feature proposals at EA contain the following information:

Title: An impactful name for your feature.
Overview: A brief description of your feature.
Value statement: An explanation of why it would be a good idea to add your feature to the game.
Solution: A description of how your feature would integrate with existing game mechanics. Oftentimes good features build on existing systems in some way, though they certainly don’t have to.
Evaluation statement: Provides a look at the pros and cons of adding your feature to the game. Includes a description of the possible benefits and risks, and addresses potential counterarguments to your proposal.


Title: Purple kick ball addon FOR FOOTBALL GAME
Overview: customer can buy the option to change or upgrade their kick animation, and perhaps upgrades the kick in game.
Value statement: fun player customization features while also being profitable
Solution: Buyable option in marketplace
